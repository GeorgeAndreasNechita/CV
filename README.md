# CV
My third project in Frontend, this is my CV in a website format. I first made my CV in Microsoft Word, everything made 
from scratch, even the design.

I tried to recreate how the CV looks when i'm editing it on Microsoft Word. It's 3 pages long and you can even see the individual pages.
I really like the end result although it doesn't have anything fancy, but this is by design as a CV is static.

Everything was made from scratch by myself without any help.
